To make short, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) seeks the shortest route visiting cities and returning to start. It is NP-hard, so approximations are used. It has practical applications in various fields. In this program it has to find the best lego tower with 4 different creteria: the diversity of legos, the tower with the most red legos, the heighest tower and the smallest one",
